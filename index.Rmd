### **Our Motivation**:

The continous developing understanding of health and medicine continues the reveal the inherent association between an individual's health and their lived-in environment. One of the biggest environmental concerns in this generation is air pollution caused by our dependence to combustible fuel sources. Hundreds of research studies have illustrated the link between outdoor air pollution (particulate matter concentration) and specific types of cancer, specifically of the lungs. Thus, we want to take a closer look at trends of levels of major air pollutants, such as NO2, SO2, and 03, and compare these trends to incidence and mortality cancer data by state, with respect to time. Our motivation for this project is to to more robustly investigate the aforementioned theories by further analyzing and evaluating the associations between pollutants and lung, pancreatic, and liver cancers at the population level with respect to time.
