# Motivation

&nbsp;

## Background and Related Works


Given the rapid progression of climate change, we have seen widespread effects on the environment, in which long-term exposure subsequently have harmful health effects that is a cause for public health concern. Major air pollutants have serious adverse effects on population health and has been linked by substantial evidence to be a large contributor to an increased burden of cancer.

Common air pollutants are responsible for pervasive inflammation throughout the body ([NSW, 2021](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/air/Pages/outdoor-air-pollution.aspx)), and long-term exposure has been linked to increased mortality for all cancers, but particularly hazardous for cancers of the lung cancer. ([Kim et. al, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266691/)).

Lung cancer is the currently the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and the most commonly diagnosed ([Turner et.al, 2020](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21632)). In fact, further exposure to air pollution after lung cancer diagnosis shortens survival compared to those exposed to lower levels of air pollution ([Schiller et. al, 2020](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.20.00609)).

&nbsp;

## Project Motivations

Current research and trends clearly demonstrate that air pollution is associated with the increase in both incidence and mortality for certain cancers.  Thus, we will to take a closer look at trends of levels of major air pollutants that are of major public health concern [as declared by the WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1): NO2, SO2, CO and 03, and compare these trends to incidence and mortality of lung cancer data by state, with respect to time. 

Our motivation for this project is to more robustly investigate the aforementioned theories by further analyzing and evaluating the associations between pollutants and lung cancer at the population level with respect to time.

The implications of such an analysis can provide justification for further research on the effects of major air pollutants on cancer survival and motivate urgency for environmental policy to slow the progression of climate change to improve quality of life and deleterious consequences on population health.

# Research Questions 

Some initial questions we considered to explore data available:

- What is the relationship between incidence rate and mortality rate of different types of cancer?
- What has been the general trend of cancer incidence, cancer mortality, and pollution levels over time?
- What is the geographical spread of cancer incidence and pollution levels in US?
- Is there any evidence of association between cancer incidence (especially lung cancer) and air pollution?

&nbsp;

# Data 

&nbsp;

## Data Source

Our project consists of data from two main sources: 

Regarding cancer statistics, we retrieved data from [American Cancer Society Cancer Statistics Center](https://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org/#!/). Raw data sets were available for download in excel format. The three data sets give us information on aggregated mortality and incidence rates from 2013 to 2017, aggregated mortality and incidence rates of various cancers at the state level from 2013 to 2017, and trends of mortality related to various cancers over time from 1930 to 2018. According to the file and website, the data source is the North American Association of Central Cancer registries. 

### *Cancer Data Code:*

Average annual rate per 100,000, age adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.

Incidence/Death Rate Per Cancer Type:

- `Cancer Type` : Type of cancer
- `Both sexes combined` : Combined rate for both female and male
- `Female` : Rate for female only
- `Male` : Rate for male only

Incidence/Death Rate Per State:

- `State` : US States including `All U.S. combined` as an observation

- Following columns for each cancer types:

  - `Both sexes combined`
  - `Female`
  - `Male`



The second data set is air pollution data in the United States from 2000 to 2016. The data was gathered by the EPA and measures air pollutant concentrations(in ppb/ppm) for major pollutants at the city/county level. This is an extremely large data set with over 174,000 observations.
[Brief description of the pollution data set](https://data.world/data-society/us-air-pollution-data)

We focused our analyses on the mean values of 4 major pollutants:

- **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)** : measured in parts per billion
- **Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)** : measured in parts per billion
- **Carbon Monoxide (CO)** : measured in parts per million
- **Ozone (O3)** : measured in parts per million

### *Pollution Data Code:*

- `State Code `: The code allocated by US EPA to each state
- `County code` : The code of counties in a specific state allocated by US EPA
- `Site Num` : The site number in a specific county allocated by US EPA
- `Address`: Address of the monitoring site
- `State` : State of monitoring site
- `County` : County of monitoring site
- `City` : City of the monitoring site
- `Date Local` : Date of monitoring

- Following Columns Per Each Pollutant:

  - `Units` : The units measured for pollutant
  - `Mean` : The arithmetic mean of concentration of pollutant within a given day
  - `AQI` : The calculated air quality index of pollutant within a given day
  - `1st Max Value` : The maximum value obtained for pollutant concentration in a given day
  - `1st Max Hour` : The hour when the maximum pollutant concentration was recorded in a given day

&nbsp;

## Data Cleaning

The pollution data was available for download in a csv format which was uploaded to repo using git LFS due to its size. Then this data was cleaned to have year, state, and the mean values of the 4 pollutants as main variables. Furthermore, observations from `Country of Mexico` was excluded to match available state data from cancer mortality trend dataset. 

```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) 
```

```{r pollution data cleaning example}
pollution = read_csv("data/uspollution_us_2000_2016.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(state, date_local, no2_mean, o3_mean, 
         so2_mean, co_mean) %>%
  separate(date_local, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "\\-") %>%
  select(-c("month", "day")) %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), mean)) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~round(., 3)) %>%
  filter(state != "Country Of Mexico") %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year)
  )
```


Additionally, to explore the relationship among different pollutant levels and cancer incidence, especially lung cancer, another version of pollution data aggregated to have mean pollutant levels from 2013 to 2017 collectively was prepared.

```{r pollution 2013-2017 cleaning example}
pollution1 =
  pollution %>% 
  filter(
    year %in% (2013:2017)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(state:co_mean) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(
    no2 = mean(no2_mean),
    o3 = mean(o3_mean),
    so2 = mean(so2_mean),
    co = mean(co_mean)
  ) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~round(., 3))
```


All cancer related data from the Cancer Statistics Center were all available in excel format for download. In order to match the time period of the pollution data containing observations from 2000 to 2016, the mortality trend data was cleaned to have observations from 2000 to 2016 only as well. Moreover, our function `remove_note` allowed cleaning observation points with notes added to only have the numeric value.

```{r death trend data cleaning example}
read_death_time =
  read_excel("data/DeathTrend.xlsx", 
             skip = 6) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

x = c("colorectum_female", "colorectum_male", "liver_and_intrahepatic_bile_duct_female", "liver_and_intrahepatic_bile_duct_male", "lung_and_bronchus_female", "lung_and_bronchus_male", "ovary_female", "uterus_cervix_and_corpus_combined_female")

remove_note = function(column_name) {
  read_death_time = read_death_time %>% 
    separate(column_name, into = c(column_name, "note"), sep = "\\-") %>% 
    select(-note)}

for (i in x) {
  read_death_time = remove_note(i)} 

death_time =
  read_death_time %>%
  filter(year %in% 2000:2016) %>%
  select(-c("breast_male", "ovary_male", "prostate_female","uterus_cervix_and_corpus_combined_male")) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-("year")), as.numeric) %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(year))
  
```

Cancer incidence and mortality datasets per state and per cancer types were similarly cleaned to have only the numeric observation values. More specifically for data per cancer type, the incidence rates for the `Colon (excluding rectum)` and `Rectum` were excluded to match similarly formatted death rate per cancer type dataset. Also, observations for `Puerto Rico` were excluded from incidence and death rate per state dataset to match the state variable available in the pollution dataset. 

```{r inc per cancer type and per state data cleaning example}
inc_cancer =
  read_excel("data/IncRate.xlsx", sheet = "All US", 
             skip = 6) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    male = if_else(male == "n/a", "0", male),
    female = if_else(female == "n/a", "0", female)
  ) %>%
  separate(both_sexes_combined, into = c("both_sexes_combined", "note"), sep = "\\-") %>%
  select(-note) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-("cancer_type")), as.numeric) %>%
  filter(cancer_type != "Colon (excluding rectum)",
         cancer_type != "Rectum")

inc_state =
  read_excel("data/IncRate.xlsx", sheet = "State", 
             skip = 6) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(
    col = breast_both_sexes_combined,
    into = c("breast_total", "female_breast_only"),
    sep = "-"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    breast_male = if_else(breast_male == "n/a", "0", breast_male),
    cervix_male = if_else(cervix_male == "n/a", "0", cervix_male),
    colon_excluding_rectum_both_sexes_combined = if_else(colon_excluding_rectum_both_sexes_combined == "n/a", "0", colon_excluding_rectum_both_sexes_combined),
    colon_excluding_rectum_female = if_else(colon_excluding_rectum_female == "n/a", "0", colon_excluding_rectum_female),
    colon_excluding_rectum_male = if_else(colon_excluding_rectum_male == "n/a", "0", colon_excluding_rectum_male),
  ) %>%
  filter(state != "Puerto Rico") %>%
  select(-c("female_breast_only", starts_with("colon"), starts_with("rectum")))
```

These cleaned up datasets were further wrangled as needed for analysis.

# Exploratory Analysis

To explore our initial research questions, we started with visual representations of each data and examining for any noticeable patterns. 

For visual plots, check out [Exploratory Analysis](exploratory-analysis.html)!


&nbsp;

The interactive dashboard of [Pollution By State](pollution_state.html) explores the distribution of the mean pollutant concentration for each of the 4 main pollutants of interest, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO, across US in 2013-2017. Some state data points are left empty as the raw data contained some missing values. 


To understand the pollution-related factors that act upon cancer incidence and death, we obtained, cleaned, and analyzed pollution data that spanned from 2000-2016. This data contained concentrations from the known pollutants NO2, O3, SO2, and CO. In the first table under the "Exploring Pollution Data Set" section, you can see the average concentrations of each pollutant in question in the United States for each year over the 17-year span. Below that, we have included another data frame with the means across the entire 17-year span. To compare the distributions of the pollutants to each other, we created a series of boxplots. As you can see, NO2 has the highest average concentration of any of the pollutants in ppm, and also has a skewed-right shape. CO and O3 have much narrowers distributions (in addition to much lower mean concentrations), making their shape harder to discern. SO2, however, appears to be approximately normally distributed. The next plot we created shows the pollution concentration with respect to time. This plot reveals that while NO2 and SO2 have been decreasing in concentration in recent years, that CO and O3 have remained relatively stable. After analyzing pollutants on their own, we combined the pollution data with our data on cancer death and incidence in order to draw conclusions on the correlative effects pollutants have on cancer. The first plot doing this shows the death trend in lung cancer over the same period of time as the previous plot of pollutants. As can be seen, lung cancer has sharply decreased from 2000-2016, which is similar to the trend we see in NO2 and SO2. The next series of plots compares the pollutant concentration to the lung cancer death rate, statifying by gender. 6 of the 8 plots show a positive, linear relationship between the pollutant concentration and death rate. The 2 plots are the exception are both for O3, which shows a negative, linear relationship with death rate. And finally, an interactive map of the US that shows incidence rate of lung/bronchus cancer by state is at the bottom of this page, and gives a visualization of regional incidence trends. From this, it can be seen that southern states and northern midwest states have the highest incidence rates of lung and bronchus cancers.
